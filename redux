REDUX:-

ACTION:- basically we will define the functions and basically we will dispatch that function (we will dispatch the function using actions)

ACTION-TYPES:- those those types of actions which we are performing like :- INCREMENT, DECREMENT, RESET

REDUCERS:- in reducer we use switch case and define that what action will be performed when clicking the buttons,,,
           the main thing in reducer is the initial state and the spread operator (...state) 

STORE:-  save all the state which present in the store
